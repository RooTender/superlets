# Superlets

This repository is a **fork** of an unofficial JAX/Python implementation of the Superlets algorithm introduced in [Time-frequency super-resolution with superlets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20539-9) (Moca et. al., 2021).

The maintenance of the main project was dropped. This is an updated version of the original work made by @irhum ([link](https://github.com/irhum/superlets)). This version shall include the optimizations and modern approach of implementation the algorithm.
